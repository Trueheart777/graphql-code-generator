The `graphql-codegen-fragment-matcher` generates a Fragment Matcher file based on your GraphQLSchema.

If you are using `apollo-client` and your schema contains `interface` or `union` declaration, it's recommended to fragment matcher.

You can read more about it [in `apollo-client` documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/advanced/fragments.html#fragment-matcher).

## Installation

    $ npm install graphql-codegen-fragment-matcher
