Upgrade generated code to match graphql-request v3.

- `@graphql-codegen/typescript-graphql-request` @ `v1` => matches `graphql-request` (v1 and v2)
- `@graphql-codegen/typescript-graphql-request` @ `v2` => matches `graphql-request` (v3)

## Breaking Changes

`v3` of `graphql-request` has changed the path of some files. That means that generated code needs to adjusted.

The actual change is described here: https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request/issues/186
